        At the same time, you can practice preventive maintenance like cleaning the air filters at regular intervals. If you are using a space heater, position it away from flammable objects. These little details are critical if you consider how debris and dust can be fire hazards when they get too close to a heat source. </th>

    	 	    <th width="40%" height="10%" align="center" bgcolor="#b2671a">ðŸ”¥More than half of kitchen fires are caused by cooking with disruptions. Remember that all it takes is a few seconds before things in the kitchen start to catch fire. Even if itâ€™s just a pot of boiling noodles, never leave your cooking unattended. Keep distractions away and focus on what youâ€™re preparing.
            Avoiding minor to major interruptions while cooking is a top priority to ensure the safety of your home. So here are a couple of things you should remember:</th>

    	 	   <th width="40%" height="10%" align="center" bgcolor="#b2671a">ðŸ”¥Before you plug something into a socket, try to be courteous in ensuring that the wire hasnâ€™t been torn or chewed up (in case you have any pets running around). Damaged wires can be a detrimental fire hazard and need replacing as soon as possible. Also, remember that wires do get hot when in use, so be sure to check your wire placement and avoiding passing them under a carpet or anywhere that could potentially catch fire.

    	 	   <th width="40%" height="10%" align="center" bgcolor="#b2671a">ðŸ”¥Fire extinguishers and blankets will be your best defence in the event of a fire breaking out. Every family member should know how to use a fire extinguisher, so in case something in your home does catch fire, it can be put out as fast as possible. Fire blankets are also very useful for putting out small fires before they become something larger and fiercer.
           There is nothing more devastating than losing all your belongings to a house fire. After all, your home is likely to be the source of many beautiful memories, and you owe it to yourself to protect it.

Place them where they canâ€™t be knocked over by anyone, especially children and pets. Keep burning candles away from things that can easily catch fire such as carpets, curtains, mattings, and papers. Better yet, use rechargeable candles, lamps, and flashlights in the absence of electricity at night.
